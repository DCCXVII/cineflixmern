# CineFlix 

CineFlix is a comprehensive open-source application for movies and series. The project is built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. Additionally, it leverages React with Vite for an enhanced development and building experience, along with Redux for state management.

## How to Set Up and Configure

To get started with this project on your local machine, you can either fork and clone the repository or download it as a zip file and extract it. After that, open the project using your preferred code editor. If you are using VS Code, you can set up two separate terminals to run the client and server individually.

### Client-side Configuration

Navigate to the Client directory and set the necessary environment variables in the .env file. Create your TMDB API connection URL and ensure it's set as your TMDB_BASE_URL. Provide the following credentials:

```
#  --- .env  ---
TMDB_BASE_URL =
TMDB_API_KEY = 
API_KEY =
```

```bash
$ cd Client
$ npm install (to install client-side dependencies)
$ npm run dev (to start the client)
```

At the vite.config.js here is the following configuration: 

This section configures the development server. The port property sets the port number to 5173. The proxy property is used for setting up a proxy to redirect requests from the client to the specified target, which is http://localhost:4000 in this case. The changeOrigin property ensures that the origin of the host header is changed to the target URL.

```
 server: {
    port: 5173,
    proxy: {
      '/api': {
        target: 'http://localhost:4000',
        changeOrigin: true,
      },
    }
  }
```


### Server-side Configuration

Navigate to the server directory and set the necessary environment variables in the .env file. Create your MongoDB connection URL and ensure it's set as your MONGO_URL. Provide the following credentials:

```
#  --- .env  ---

MODE_ENV = 
# by default development mode, you can put it on production mode when you finish developing it

MONGO_URL = 
PORT = 
TOKEN_KEY = 
```

Then, execute the following commands:

```bash
$ cd Server
$ npm install (to install server-side dependencies)
$ npm install (to start the server)
```
