A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

# CineFlix

CineFlix is a comprehensive open-source application for movies and series. The project is built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. Additionally, it leverages React with Vite for an enhanced development and building experience, along with Redux for state management.

## How to Set Up and Configure

To get started with this project on your local machine, you can either fork and clone the repository or download it as a zip file and extract it. After that, open the project using your preferred code editor. If you are using VS Code, you can set up two separate terminals to run the client and server individually.

### Client-side Configuration

```bash
$ cd Client
$ npm install (to install client-side dependencies)
$ npm run dev (to start the client)
```

### Server-side Configuration

Navigate to the server directory and set the necessary environment variables in the .env file. Create your MongoDB connection URL and ensure it's set as your MONGO_URL. Provide the following credentials:

```
#  --- .env  ---

MONGODB_URL
PORT =5000
TOKEN_SECRET=
TMDB_BASE_URL=
TMDB_KEY=
```

Then, execute the following commands:

```bash
$ cd Server
$ npm install (to install server-side dependencies)
$ npm install (to start the server)
```
